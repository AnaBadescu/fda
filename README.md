I created this account as part of my master thesis at Complutense University,
I've utilized several libraries and packages in my Functional Data Analysis (FDA) workflow to efficiently process and analyze the data. The "reshape2" library (Wickham, 2020) has been instrumental in rearranging data frames, making it easier to work with data in different formats. To manage date and time data seamlessly, the "lubridate" package (Spinu, 2023) has been invaluable, offering functions that simplify date manipulation. Additionally, the "wesanderson" package (Ram, 2018) has been helpful in creating visually appealing color palettes, enhancing the aesthetic quality of my plots. 

For the core FDA tasks, I've heavily relied on the "fda" package (Ramsay, 2023), which provides a range of functionalities such as generating B-spline basis functions, smoothing functional data, and conducting various analyses. The "tidyverse" package (Hadley Wickham), known for its data manipulation and visualization capabilities, has been instrumental in wrangling data, creating plots, and generating summaries. Moreover, I've used the "patchwork" (Lin. 2023) package to seamlessly combine multiple plots into unified visual layouts. The "fda.usc" (Febrero, 2022) package extends the capabilities of the "fda" package and the "funFEM" package (Bouveyron, 2021) has enabled me to cluster functional data. Furthermore, as part of my FDA analysis, I had intended to use the "funHDDC" (CRAN repository)package for multivariate clustering. However, I regret to mention that this package has recently become unavailable, preventing me from exploring its potential contributions to my analysis.
